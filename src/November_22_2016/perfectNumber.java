/**3.	Program: Write a program to find perfect number or not. 
Description: A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, 
that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. Equivalently, a perfect number
 is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. 
 Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors. 
The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2 and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
 Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors:
